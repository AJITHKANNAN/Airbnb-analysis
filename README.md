# Airbnb-analysis
# Steps to be followed

**Step 1: MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval**
1.1. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas and create a new project.
1.2. Set up a cluster within your project.
1.3. Configure database access and network access in MongoDB Atlas.
1.4. Load the Airbnb sample data into your cluster.

**Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation**
2.1. Connect to MongoDB Atlas using a suitable MongoDB driver in your preferred programming language (e.g., Python with PyMongo).
2.2. Retrieve the Airbnb dataset using MongoDB queries.
2.3. Perform data cleaning tasks:
- Handle missing values by imputation or removal.
- Remove duplicates from the dataset.
- Convert data types for accurate analysis.

**Step 3: Geospatial Visualization with Streamlit**
3.1. Install Streamlit: pip install streamlit
3.2. Create a Streamlit web application script.
3.3. Use the retrieved geospatial data to create interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings.
3.4. Implement filters and options for users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors on the maps.

**Step 4: Price Analysis and Visualization**
4.1. Utilize the cleaned data to analyze price variations across locations, property types, and seasons.
4.2. Create dynamic plots and charts using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize price trends.
4.3. Implement interactive features to allow users to explore and filter the data.

**Step 5: Availability Analysis by Season**
5.1. Analyze the availability of Airbnb listings based on seasonal variations.
5.2. Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations using line charts, heatmaps, or other suitable visualizations.
5.3. Incorporate interactive elements for users to examine availability patterns across different seasons.

**Step 6: Location-Based Insights**
6.1. Use MongoDB queries and aggregation to extract location-based insights.
6.2. Visualize the extracted information on interactive maps or other suitable visualizations.
6.3. Allow users to explore and analyze pricing variations in specific regions or neighborhoods.

**Step 7: Interactive Visualizations**
7.1. Enhance the interactivity of visualizations to enable users to filter and drill down into the data.
7.2. Implement features such as dropdowns, sliders, or checkboxes for user customization.
7.3. Ensure a smooth and responsive user experience in the web application.

S**tep 8: Dashboard Creation with Tableau or Power BI**
8.1. Export the cleaned and prepared data for use in Tableau or Power BI.
8.2. Create a comprehensive dashboard by combining various visualizations.
8.3. Include maps, charts, and tables to present key insights from the analysis.
8.4. Ensure that the dashboard provides a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

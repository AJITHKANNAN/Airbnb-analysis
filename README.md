# Steps to be followed

**1. MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:**  

Install the necessary MongoDB driver for your programming language (e.g., pymongo for Python).
Use the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas to establish a connection to your cluster.
Retrieve the Airbnb dataset by querying the relevant collections (listings, reviews, users) using the MongoDB driver.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

Identify and handle missing values, either by imputation or removal.
Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Convert data types as needed (e.g., convert date strings to datetime objects).
Normalize or scale numerical features if required.
Ensure consistency in data format for geospatial analysis.

**3. Geospatial Visualization:**

Use a streamlit web application to create interactive maps.
Utilize the geospatial information in the dataset (latitude, longitude) to showcase the distribution of Airbnb listings.
Allow users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors by interacting with the map.

**4. Price Analysis and Visualization:**

Analyze price variations across different dimensions (location, property type, seasons).
Create dynamic plots and charts using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize trends and correlations.
Provide users with the ability to filter and explore price data interactively.

**5. Availability Analysis by Season:**

Aggregate data based on seasons and analyze availability patterns.
Use line charts, heatmaps, or other suitable visualizations to depict occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
Provide insights into booking patterns throughout the year.

**6. Location-Based Insights:**

Use MongoDB queries and aggregation to extract location-based information.
Visualize price variations across different regions or neighborhoods.
Provide users with the ability to explore specific locations through interactive maps.

**7. Interactive Visualizations:**

Develop dynamic and interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly or Bokeh.
Allow users to filter data based on preferences such as region, property type, or time period.
Implement interactive features to enhance user engagement and exploration.

**8. Dashboard Creation:**

Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard.
Combine different visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to present key insights.
Ensure the dashboard provides a holistic view of pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.
